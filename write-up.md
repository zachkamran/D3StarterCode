## GOOD VIS
The intention was to make it extremly easy to determine which injury had the longest recovery time and which was most likely to occur. To identify the categorical variable of which body part each point is we use color of the dot. To identify the percent of total injuries we use a x scale and to identify the recovery time we use the y scale. This makes it very easy to view the injuries and parts with high and low recoveries and percent occurances.

In this vis I was folloign the correct usage of scales for type of variable. This makes it easy to view the distribution of the data. 

## BAD VIS
The intention of this vis is to make it hard to determine which dot is which part and the percent value that each size corresponds to. While possible it is extremly annoying to do both. 

In particuaar we use the size of the circle to show a scale value which violates principles as we are showing linear value in non linear manner. Additioanly we use the height of each cirlce to represent the Category. This again is bad usage of a scale. 

To identify the body part we use the x scale and height represents the category. To reprsent recovery time we use the x scale. This is not terribly hard to read. To represnt the percent of injures we use circle size. Reading this makes my head hurt, but it is possible to do.
